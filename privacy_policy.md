This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the InfoWarrior app for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

## History of changes

February 3, 2017: First published.

## Information we collect

We get a secure, globally unique representation of the currently logged-in iCloud account used in the iOS app that does not reveal your email address or password. This is used to uniquely identify you between devices and only through the InfoWarrior app.

If you enable push notifications, we need to store the token your device gives us to send them. We only ever use push notifications to initiate background refreshing and notify you of new articles that pertain to the categories you selected to be notified of. We never use push notifications for marketing.

## Premium subscription asking to share email, ZIP code, etc.

If you subscribe to InfoWarrior Premium in the app, an Apple system dialog may ask you to optionally share your email address, postal code, or other information with us.

We don’t want this data, and we encourage you to decline. We  don’t care who you are or where you live.

But at the time of writing, Apple does not offer InfoWarrior a way to opt out of this data collection, and it will be available to us from anyone who opts in. If we ever access this data, we will never use it for marketing purposes or disclose it to any third parties.

### Additional information collected by anonymous analytics

InfoWarrior’s iOS app includes limited components of Twitter’s Fabric to provide crash reporting and basic analytics to help us improve the app. These are aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features.

InfoWarrior does not share any personal data with Twitter. Other data, such as articles being read or shared, may be shared anonymously for aggregate statistical analysis to further improve the app.

### Additional information collected by in-app ads

InfoWarrior’s iOS app includes Facebook Audience Network ads. Facebook may use the advertising identifier from your device(s) to infer interests, demographics, and other data to show you more relevant ads. Your device advertising identifier can be disabled or reset by following these instructions from Apple.

InfoWarrior does not share any personal data with Facebook. Other data, such as articles being read and their categories, may be shared anonymously for ad targeting.

Becoming a Premium user disables all advertisements and sharing of targeting data.

## Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.

We do not share your personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish InfoWarrior’s functionality, except as specified above for analytics and in-app advertisements.

We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as how many people listen to a particular podcast with InfoWarrior.

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## Security

We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure.

For instance, all communication with the app and server requires HTTPS, and passwords are not stored: they are hashed using advanced, well-researched methods.

## Accessing your information

You may access or change your information or delete your account at any time by logging into the app or website.

## Third-party links and content

InfoWarrior displays links and content from Infowars.com. Infowars have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

## Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

## Your Consent

By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Contacting Us

If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email infowarriorapp@gmail.com.

## Changes to this policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page and update the Privacy Policy modification date above.
